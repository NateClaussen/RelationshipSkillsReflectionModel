			<h2>Explanation</h2>
			<p>
				Using Knapps Relationship Model, we can analyze how
				relationships are started between two people and also how they
				can end. Using this website, you can use the "A" and "D" keys or
				the Left and right arrow keys to move the couple through each
				part of their relationship.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Initiating Phase:</strong> This phase is where the
					relationship has the potential to be formed. It can happen
					in mere seconds on whether or not you engage with another
					person. If you choose to initiate with another person, then
					the relationship has officially begun!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Experimenting Phase:</strong> This phase is where
					you explore the relationship further and see if there is a
					genuine connection. You can talk about common interests and
					start to see what works. A lot of times, this phase can be
					very surface level and does not get too deep.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Intensifying Phase:</strong> This phase is where the
					relationship starts to become more serious. As the name
					suggests, this is very high enery and your relationship has
					started to kick off to a great start! You will start sharing
					personal stories and share experiences together.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Integrating Phase:</strong> In this phase, you begin
					to start thinking of yourself as a couple and other people
					can see that you are together. You start considering
					yourself as "we" and "us" instead of just "I" and "Me".
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Bonding Phase:</strong> This phase is where you are
					connected with someone to the point where you are in a
					blissful happiness. This phase is usually denoted by a
					serious act, such as marriage, and at this point, you have a
					strong relationship!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Differentiation Phase:</strong> After the honeymoon
					phase is over, you start to see things that you might not
					like. You realize that you don't like everything that the
					other person likes, and you start setting healthy boundaries
					and communicating openly with your parter.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Circumscribing Phase:</strong> This phase is where
					you are still in a healthy relationship, but maybe there is
					a thing or two that is starting to build a wedge between the
					two of you. You have a choice to either address the concerns
					and improve the relationship back to Circumsribing, or you
					can let it deteriorate towards Stagnation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Stagnation Phase:</strong> This phase is where you
					start to get kind of numb to your dissagreements. You start
					avoiding conversations, especially ones about the conflicts
					that you are having. You start putting more and more
					distance between you and your partner.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Avoiding Phase:</strong> In this phase, you do
					everything you can to just avoid the other person. You start
					making excuses to not be in the same place, and you really
					try to stop communicating altogether
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Terminating Phase:</strong> This phase is the end of
					the road for the relationship. This phase usually involves a
					final big action (depending on how serious the relationship
					ended up getting to), such as a breakup or divorce. You do
					not want to see the other person again, and the relationship
					is no more.
				</li>
